To guarantee that A* will produce the optimal solution, we cannot have
a heuristic that overestimates cost to the goal. This is due to the rule of
admissible heuristics. Since we know that the range is
in between 20% under and 20% over, we can underestimate the heuristic again by
that 20%, so that at most, it will estimate at the exact cost of the goal,
and otherwise, it will underestimate the goal, which according to A* will
still produce a guaranteed optimal solution (just not the fastest).

2)
False. This is because each xanadu may also act as a piece to help another xanadu
to reach the escape hatch. It may occur that one xanadu has to move away from the
center, in order for another xanadu to get into escape hatch. In this way, it is
not admissible. If an algorithm has increasing heuristic values to get to a
solution, then this by definition is not admissible.
